Welcome to respy's documentation!
=================================

`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/respy>`_ | `GitHub <https://github.com/restudToolbox/package>`_  | `Issues <https://gitlab.com/restudToolbox/package/issues>`_

``respy`` is a Python package for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical discrete choice dynamic programming model. We build on the baseline model presented in:

    Michael P. Keane, Kenneth I. Wolpin (1994). `The Solution and Estimation of Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming Models by Simulation and Interpolation: Monte Carlo Evidence <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2109768>`_. *The Review of Economics and Statistics*, 76(4): 648-672.

This documentation is best understood with a sound knowledge of their paper as we will repeatedly reference it.
