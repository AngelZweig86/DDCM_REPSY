Background
==========

The **respy** package is a research tool. It provides the computational starting point for several research papers.

    Philipp Eisenhauer, Stefan Wild (2016). *Numerical Upgrade to Finite-Horizon Discrete Choice Programming Models*. Unpublished Manuscript

However, it is also intended to showcase how combining economic expertise with software engineering and knowledge of numerical methods, allows economists to conduct computation intensive research in a transparent and reliable way.

So, for the rest of this documentation, we will first discuss the economics of the underlying model. Then outline the capabilities of the **respy** package. Then we outline the details about the numerical methods and provide some background information on how software engineering tools helps develop, maintain, and extend the capabilities of the package over time. Then we document the overall reliability and scalability of the parallel implementations.
