Background
==========

The ``respy`` package is a research tool. It provides the computational starting point for several research papers that analyze the economics driving agents' educational and occupational choices over their life-cycle within the framework of a finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model.

Here are some recent examples:

    Philipp Eisenhauer (2016). *The Approximate Solution of Finite-Horizon Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming Models: Revisiting Keane & Wolpin (1994)*. Unpublished Manuscript

    Philipp Eisenhauer, Stefan M. Wild (2016). *Numerical Upgrade to Finite-Horizon Discrete Choice Programming Models*. Unpublished Manuscript

    Philipp Eisenhauer (2016). *Risk and Ambiguity in Dynamic Models of Educational Choice*. Unpublished Manuscript

We provide the package and its documentation to ensure the transparency, reliability, recomputability, and extensibility of this research. We hope to showcase how software engineering practices can help in achieving these objectives.

The rest of this documentation is structured as follows. First, we provide the installation instructions. Then we turn to a discussion of the underlying economic model, before we illustrate the basic capabilities of the package in a tutorial. Next, we provide more details regarding the numerical methods used for the computations. Then we showcase the package's reliability and scalability. We conclude with a presentation of the software engineering practices adopted for the ongoing development of the package.
