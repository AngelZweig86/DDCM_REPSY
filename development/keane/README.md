# Monte Carlo Evidence from Keane and Wolpin (1994)

The material in this directory allows to reproduce the Monte Carlo results reported in the two papers below:

> Michael P. Keane, Kenneth I. Wolpin (1994). The Solution and Estimation of Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming Models by Simulation and Interpolation: Monte Carlo Evidence. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, No. 181.

> Michael P. Keane, Kenneth I. Wolpin (1994). The Solution and Estimation of Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming Models by Simulation and Interpolation: Monte Carlo Evidence. The Review of Economics and Statistics, 76(4): 648-672.


#### Execution
 
    $ python create.py

The resulting choice probabilities reported in **data.robupy.info** align with their results provided in **original-results.pdf**. Minor discrepancies are due to randomness.
