The material in this directory allows to reproduce the Monte Carlo results reported in the original papers by Prof. Keane and Prof. Wolpin. 

The two relevant papers are:

> Michael P. Keane, Kenneth I. Wolpin (1994). The Solution and Estimation of Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming Models by Simulation and Interpolation: Monte Carlo Evidence. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, No. 181.

> Michael P. Keane, Kenneth I. Wolpin (1994). The Solution and Estimation of Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming Models by Simulation and Interpolation: Monte Carlo Evidence. The Review of Economics and Statistics, 76(4): 648-672.

Executing the scripts ''create.py'' simulates the Monte Carlo samples for their reported specifications. The resulting choice probabilities reported in ``data.robupy.info'' align with their results provided in ``original-results.pdf''. Minor discrepancies are due to randomness.
